      When asked what someone wants most out of life, the majority would answer: ‘I just want to be happy.’ Yet many of us lead lives that are too rushed, too stressed and too focused on things that don’t really matter. For some of us, our lifestyles are making us physically and mentally unwell – they’re making us unhappier, not happier. For the month of May, Edmonton City Centre is sprinkling a little happiness to its retailers, shoppers and the downtown community.
